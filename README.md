# ETLCodeOptimization
ETL Pipeline and SQL You are a member of the Bebop, an eclectic interplanetary bar/ship dealing mostly in rare weapons. Your boss has recently tasked you with organizing the shipâ€™s transactional data, as he is looking to make operations more efficient and increase booty for the ship. Section A: The transaction log includes invoice number, customer id, purchases, date, and planet of each transaction from 2010-2011. The log itself is in chronological order, but its fields are messy (e.g. dates can be strings or integers). Your boss anticipates you will turn the raw data into something that he will be able to examine and use easily. Please use Python to read the raw data file (located here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/11t5bbgggrekt85/data.csv.zip?dl=0) and clean and transform its fields.
